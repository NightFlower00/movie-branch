    <h1>Is the movie "Ready Player One" our future?</h1>

    <p>Since the movie "Ready Player One came out, me and my father has been obbessed with watching it since it has lots
        of hidden clues in the movie that you wont notice the first few times you watch it. You have to pay close
        attention to find the hidden clues throughout the movie.
        It's a movie about a world that went to shit and everyone escapes it by going to virtual reality to have the
        world they want to have. For example you can build your avatar the way you want like a character in the game
        "call of Duty"or Pincess Daisy or even a Monster. You can also choose where you want to be. Either you want to
        be at a beach in Hawaii or doing missions with Batman.
        It's also a video game so you can play missions and win coins to buy cool outfits and home. The catch of the
        movie is that youll make good money if you find the 3 hidden keys in that world and with that there are clues
        and missions that you have to do. It's more a riddle movie if anything.</p>

    <p>
        i feel like thats how our current world will be in a few decades because theres so much political problems
        happening that everyone just want to escape it to go somewhere thats peaceful. With the expirience of COVID,
        many people want to stay indoors more than ever.
        Thats how the movie "Ready Player One" plays out. Everyones home but at the same time they aren't. Their mind
        are in a virtual reality.

    <p>
        I highly recommend this movie if your a gamer and also into finding clues and riddles.

        It is also a good bonding time with your family if your into it.

        Based on the 2011 novel by Ernest Cline, "Ready Player One" paints a rather pessimistic view of society's
        growing dependence on technology, but also depicts the fantastical possibilities presented by VR and other
        futuristic technologies.
